comment: |
  An "objects" section defines variables that are docassemble objects.
  The object types here are defined in the docassemble.base.core and
  docassemble.base.legal modules.

code: |
  case.court = court
  pleading.case = case
comment: |
  This code sets some basic relations among the objects created in the
  objects block of this YAML file.

generic object: Individual
question: |
  What is ${ x.possessive('e-mail address') }?
fields:
  - E-mail: x.email
    datatype: email
comment: |
  The datatype "email" presents a text box that is like ordinary text
  boxes except that validation is applied that checks to make sure the
  e-mail address is valid.  Also, on supporting mobile web browsers,
  there is a different keyboard option (e.g, the @ sign is readily
  available).

generic object: Individual
question: |
  What is ${ x.object_possessive('name') }?
fields:
  - First Name: x.name.first
    default: ${ x.first_name_hint() }
  - Middle Name: x.name.middle
    required: False
  - Last Name: x.name.last
    default: ${ x.last_name_hint() }
  - Suffix: x.name.suffix
    required: False
    code: |
      name_suffix()
comment: |
  If the object does not have a name yet, generic questions can refer
  to it by the name of the variable itself.  For example, suppose you
  create an object, case.judge, with the class of Individual.  If the
  name of case.judge is ever needed, docassemble will use the question
  above to ask "What is the name of the judge in the case?"  If the
  object is called user, it will ask "What is your name?"  If the
  object is called village_idiot, it will ask "What is the village
  idiot's name?"

default role: client
code: |
  multi_user = True
  if user_logged_in() and user_has_privilege('advocate'):
    user = attorney
    role = 'attorney'
  else:
    user = client
    role = 'client'
  set_info(user=user, role=role)
comment: |
  The default role is "client" and an optional role is "attorney."
  Unless otherwise specified, all questions require the user to be a
  "client."  The user is assumed to have the "attorney" role in this
  interview if the user is logged in and the user has "attorney" as a
  user role.
  The functions in docassemble.base.util need to know who the user
  is.  The set_info function communicates that information to the
  docassemble.base.util module.  Since the code is paired with the
  "default role" declaration, this code is run as "initial" code,
  meaning that it is run every time docassemble processes the
  interview (i.e., every time the screen loads).
