  - Middle Name: x.name.middle
    required: False
  - Last Name: x.name.last
    default: ${ x.last_name_hint() }

      name_suffix()
# comment: |
#   If the object does not have a name yet, generic questions can refer
#   to it by the name of the variable itself.  For example, suppose you
#   create an object, case.judge, with the class of Individual.  If the
#   name of case.judge is ever needed, docassemble will use the question
#   above to ask "What is the name of the judge in the case?"
