*Re: Letter of Engagement*

Dear ${ Matter.Client.Prefix }. ${ Matter.Client.LastName }:  

This letter confirms the terms on which we will partner with you as the outside general counsel for ${ Matter.Client.Name }.  

Scope of services covered.   We will receive a flat fee in exchange for full access to our time, advice, and consultation regarding routine day-to-day legal issues and matters that you may encounter. We refer to these as “general counsel services.” These may include business, corporate, employment, and human resources issues, basic contract or document review and advice, problem solving, pre-litigation negotiation and dispute resolution, and the like.  Whether a matter or issue falls outside the scope of this agreement will be handled with common sense, mutual respect, and fairness to both parties.

Commencement of Representation.  We agree that the retainer under this Agreement takes effect as of ${ Effective.Date }. 

Amount of Monthly Fee. You agree to pay Innocenti Jones a monthly flat fee of $[NBSP]${ Monthly.Flat.Fee }.  

Recording time. Our goal is to create an open, flexible relationship that allows you the freedom to consult us without being concerned about the expense associated with every call or email or issue you ask us to consider.  For that reason, we do not anticipate tracking the precise amount of time spent on each individual communication or consultation.  However, to facilitate future discussions about the reasonableness of the monthly fee amount to you and to us, we will track the amount of time spent on substantive projects requiring more than an hour of time.

Billing for services outside the scope of this agreement.  If you require services on a matter that we both agree falls outside of the scope of our general counsel services, we will handle this on mutually-acceptable fee terms and pursuant to a separate fee agreement. These fee terms may be hourly, a contingent fee, a blend of hourly and contingent, or a lump sum, as we both agree is most appropriate for each separate matter. Our current rates are $[NBSP]${ Hourly.Overage.Fee } per hour. Examples of matters that may fall outside of the scope of general counsel matters are complex commercial transactions, litigation, regulatory matters, or personal matters.

Modification of monthly amount.   After the first ${ Initial.Term } months of this engagement, with reasonable notice, we or you may propose to modify this agreement.  We agree to review the amount of actual time expended and the future expectations and discuss whether an adjustment is appropriate. 

Termination. At any time, with reasonable written notice, you or we may terminate this agreement.  If that happens, we agree to comply with all applicable ethical requirements to ensure that you are not prejudiced by that termination. 

Matters outside of our expertise. For matters outside of our expertise, such as personal injury, worker’s compensation, real estate, etc., we will advise you that an issue or matter is outside our expertise and, in that event, will make every reasonable effort to refer you to experienced and competent outside counsel.  

Client.  ${ Matter.Client.Name } will be our client.  Our representation of ${ Matter.Client.Name } does not mean that we represent any managers, officers, directors, managers, employees, or shareholders in their individual capacities. 

Conflicts of Interest. We will be bound by our ethical obligations and the Texas Lawyers Creed regarding conflicts of interest, which may require us to decline to provide advice, consultation, or representation on certain matters which would otherwise be considered general counsel matters.  As you utilize our services, we will investigate conflicts or potential conflicts on an ongoing basis and will promptly advise you.

Dispute resolution. We agree to make a good faith effort to resolve any question, claim, or issue regarding fees or If we are unable to resolve any differences regarding fees or expenses billed or incurred under this agreement, we both agree to submit the issue to the Fee Dispute Committee of San Antonio Bar Association for resolution and to be bound by that Committee’s decision.    

Thank you very much for selecting us to represent you.  We look forward to working with you in a mutually beneficial relationship.

Sincerely,

Innocenti Jones PLLC
